Face Recognition Attendance System
This project is a real-time face recognition-based attendance system built using:

OpenCV for face detection and recognition

Streamlit for the user interface

CSV for attendance data storage

📸 Features
✅ Live face detection using webcam
✅ Face recognition using LBPH algorithm
✅ Real-time attendance marking
✅ Stores attendance in a CSV file with Name, Date, Time
✅ Simple Streamlit-based UI for ease of use

🛠️ Requirements
Install the required Python libraries before running:

pip install opencv-python streamlit numpy pandas


🧠 How It Works
Face Detection: Haarcascade frontal face detection.

Face Recognition: LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms).

Attendance Logging: Logged with timestamp in attendance.csv once per session.

📌 Future Enhancements
Email or SMS notification on attendance

Dashboard to view logs and statistics

Face registration via Streamlit UI

Database (MySQL or Firebase) integration
